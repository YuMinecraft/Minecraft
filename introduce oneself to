# Minecraft
I love Minecraft
Hello, everyone!
I'm a minecraft Chinese player and I'm keen on minecraft.
I've played minecraft for three years, and my technique is relatively good.
I don't have a genuine one because it costs 165 RMB in China.
But I play minecraft JE with a third party minecraft launcher.
I hope you can take care of me.
I'm Chinese and my English is not good.
